## Data

Variables prefixed with 't' are time domain signals. Variables prefixed with
'f' are frequency derived signals.

The magnitude of the original three-dimensional signals were calculated using the
Euclidean norm; these have 'Mag' in the variable name.

The original signals were normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

## Transformations

The data is the average by subject and activity of the mean and standard
deviation of the features in the original Samsung data set. There is some minor
cleanup of the original variable names.
